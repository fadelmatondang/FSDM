Description: This package implements the Fuzzy Systems Dynamics Model which
    is similar to fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM) in representing a model of causal
    effects as a digraph but uses different mathematical and algorithmic approach to 
    calculating the effects of the change in one concept on the change in another.
    Whereas the in the FCM approach the states of concepts are related to one 
    another, in the FSDM approach the changes in the states of concepts are related
    to one another. The changes in state are a function of edge weights in the
    digraph which identify the causal strength and the respective values of the
    anterior and posterior concepts in the relationship. Because change in the model
    is a function of both the value of concepts and their changes, approach is
    somewhat similar to the systems dynamics model approach but with a simpler
    representation of dynamic relationships.
